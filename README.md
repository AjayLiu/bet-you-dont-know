<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="preview.png"></img>

Players can create lobbies (private or public) and invite their friends to play via URL. The game involves 2 main stages: answering and betting. During the answering phase, a single player answers a trivia question. During the betting phase, all the other players will place bets hoping that the answerer got the trivia question wrong: the higher the bet, the more money they can steal from the answerer. Look below for rules and example.

<details>
  <summary>Rules</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Players take turns answering trivia questions.</p>
    <p>On your turn:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Answer the trivia question displayed. (multiple choice)</li>
      <li>All other players can place bets hoping that you answered incorrectly.</li>
      <li>If their prediction was right (you got the question wrong), you will have to pay however much they betted on you.</li>
      <li>However, if you proved them wrong and answered correctly, you will earn $1000 AND everyone who didn't believe in you will have to pay their bets to you!</li>

  </div>
</details>

### Example
<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <p>It's Bob's turn to answer:</p>
      <li>Bob answers the question: What is 1+1? Bob bluffs that he can't do math.</li>
      <li>John believes that Bob is indeed bad at math and bets $500 that Bob will answer incorrectly.</li>
      <li>No way! Bob guessed correctly and won $1000. Additionally, because John made an incorrect prediction, $500 is deducted from his balance and given to Bob!</li>
    </ol>
